# Overview

This is a personal development website that I created for one of my classes and it was created using HTML 5, CSS, and the Boostrap framework. The code is highly customizable and can be utilized for many different uses. The comments in the HTML indicate where each section of the website is for easier customization.

This is my first webstie that I have built/published from scratch using nothing but HTML 5, CSS, and a set of rules set by my instructor.

### Styling
A lot of the fonts and color schemes were chosen for clarity and easy readability, utilizing high contrasts and easy fonts such as Noto Sans and Ubuntu.

### Privacy and Security
Some of the links and photos have been removed for personal privacy and saftey, you can edit them as you see fit and as desired for personal needs.
